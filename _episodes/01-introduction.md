In this section we will talk about the different parts of a spreadsheet, what makes them different, and how we can use their features to our advantage. 

## Components of a Spreadsheet

While we have probably used a spreadsheet in Excel for one reason or another, you probably haven't given much thought to the different components of that spreadsheet. We will go through a quick primer to make sure that we are all on the same page.

**Rows** are the horizontal series of data in your spreadsheet. They are indexed with letters, starting at 1. Rows typically store data for one *observation* - the data for one sample that you have run for example. There is usually one piece of information in a row that is unique from the other rows, like a sample number or a part number.

**Columns** are the vertical component of your data. They are indexed with letters. Columns typically have the data for one field or variable for all of the observations - the weight of each of the samples for example. The headings for the columns should be descriptive and it is helpful if they have the unit of measure. It is not good practice to use the letter as your only way to identify the column, as they can be moved or deleted.

**Cells** are the smallest component of a spreadsheet. A cell represents the value for one variable for one observation - the weight of sample #0001 for example. They are represented by the column letter and row number (for example, A1 is the cell in the top left corner of your spreadsheet).
